If you're here it likely means that you:
- Love our product and want to help make it better
- Hate our product and want to help make it better
- Clicked the wrong place. 
Whichever it is, we want to know what you think, would you suggest ProcessHub to someone else?
We don't know and all feedback is welcome at __jun.a.kagaya@gmail.com__

## How to Use:

- Create Processes by installing the extension via _link coming soon_
- Once your process is saved, you can view it via the __Process__ tab in the extension (_screenshot coming soon_)
- When the process runs, it will be bundled and emailed to you.

## Disclaimer

We're in version __v0.0.1__, what does this mean? 
It means you can expect _bugs_, and _issues_ to crop up.
It also means you're one of the early users, and will have a direct impact in helping us to build a better product.

## Roadmap

We've got a lot of features to implement, and your feedback will help us determine what to prioritize.
- A website to replace the Chrome extension with a detailed view of all processes, as well as your own accounts
- Graphs and analytics to view the data your processes have collected
- Smarter features in the extension to detect patterns in the websites, (_e.g. pagination_)
