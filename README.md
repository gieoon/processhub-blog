## What is ProcessHub

ProcessHub is an automation robot that reproduces online actions. 
Instead of repeating an action multiple times, let ProcessHub do it for you.

Here are some examples to inspire you:
- Track prices from websites online and be notified if a price falls within a certain range
- Receive data from online sources at scheduled intervals
- Automation testing of your websites to ensure no new bugs have been introduced, and quality can be assured.
- Move a lot of data from __A__ to __B__.
- Move data from __A__ to __B__ many times.

## How to Use:

1. Install the Chrome extension [Process Hub Creator Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/processhub-creator-tool/ipfoehnmpmmpljcaakgenkcddjbfapan)
1. Press __Record__ and perform your actions as you normally would.
1. Set a frequency for how often you want the actions to give you data, or else set it to __Now__ if you want to run this only once.
1. Press __Save__ when you're done.
1. Once your process is saved, you can view it via the __Process__ tab in a Google Spreadsheet.
1. When the process runs, it will be bundled and emailed to your Google account if you are signed in, or just saved to a spreadsheet if you are not.


## Disclaimer

We're currently in version __v0.3__, what does this mean? 
It means you can expect regular _bugs_, and _issues_.
It also means you're one of our early users and adopters, and will have a direct impact in helping us build a better product.

## Roadmap

We've got a lot of features to implement, and your feedback will help us prioritize what needs to be done.

## Our Vision

Automation is going to take over the world, it's just a matter of _when_. 
Andrew Yang is preaching a Universal Basic Income, because a multitude of jobs will inevitably be taken over by automation. This is exciting, but also daunting. What we know to be normal will change. 
Tools like ProcessHub will continue to emerge as part of the automation revolution and dramatically infuence peoples' lives. Much of the repetitive tasks that we experience everyday will be automated away, leaving time for people to be kind, compassionate, and creative with one another.

Our goal is to create a system intelligent enough to not only perform routine tasks, but to also be able to make intelligent decisions and handle recurring pain points.

Let humans be creative, not data entry robots.
