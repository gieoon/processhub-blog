## How to Use:

1. Create Processes by installing the extension via _link coming soon_
2. Once your process is saved, you can view it via the __Process__ tab in the extension (_screenshot coming soon_)
3. When the process runs, it will be bundled and emailed to your Google account if you are signed in

## Disclaimer

We're in version __v0.0.1__, what does this mean? 
It means you can expect regular _bugs_, and _issues_.
It also means you're one of our early users and adopters, and will have a direct impact in helping us to build a better product.

## Roadmap

We've got a lot of features to implement, your feedback will help us prioritize.
- A website to replace the Chrome extension with a detailed view of all processes, as well as your own accounts
- Graphs and analytics to view the data your processes have collected
- Smarter features in the extension to be able to create processes on more complex websites

## Our Vision

Automation is going to take over the world, it's just a matter of _when_. This is exciting, but also daunting. What we know to be normal is going to change. We hope that ProcessHub will be able to assist people in front of their computers, automating much of the repetitive tasks that we experience everyday. Our goal is to create a system intelligent enough to make decisions in sensitive areas.
