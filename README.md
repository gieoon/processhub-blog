If you're here it likely means that you:
- Love our product and want to help make it better
- Hate our product and want to help make it better
- Need a new mouse. 

Whichever it is, we want to know what you think, would you suggest ProcessHub to someone else?
### All feedback is welcome at __jun.a.kagaya@gmail.com__

## How to Use:

- Create Processes by installing the extension via _link coming soon_
- Once your process is saved, you can view it via the __Process__ tab in the extension (_screenshot coming soon_)
- When the process runs, it will be bundled and emailed to you.

## Disclaimer

We're in version __v0.0.1__, what does this mean? 
It means you can expect _bugs_, and _issues_ to crop up.
It also means you're one of our early users and adopters, and will have a direct impact in helping us to build a better product.

## Our Vision

Automation is going to take over the world, it's just a matter of _when_. This is exciting, but also daunting. What we know to be normal is going to change. We hope that ProcessHub will be able to assist people in front of their computers, automating much of the repetitive tasks that we experience everyday. Our goal is to create a system intelligent enough to make decisions in sensitive areas.

## Roadmap

We've got a lot of features to implement, and your feedback will help us determine what to prioritize.
- A website to replace the Chrome extension with a detailed view of all processes, as well as your own accounts
- Graphs and analytics to view the data your processes have collected
- Smarter features in the extension to detect patterns in the websites, (_e.g. pagination_)
